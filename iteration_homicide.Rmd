```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
  )

  options(

  scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
  
  theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
  
```

## Read in dataset
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 

```

## Aggregate at the city level
```{r}
city_homicide_df =
  homicide_df %>%
  select(city_state, resolution, disposition) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
      hom_total = n()
  )
```

## For one city ...

... get the estimated rate of unsolved homicides and CI using prop.test() and broom::tidy()

```{r}
prop.test(x = 1825, n = 2827)
```

```{r}
#prop.test(
  #x = city_homicide_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD"), n = 2827

```

## Repeat for all cities
